      <h1>The Black Isles</h1>
      <img class="banner_image" src="img/jan-ditlev-prey.jpg" alt="Interior of Black Isles">
      <p>While the world tore itself to pieces around them the brave people of the Black Isles burrowed deep beneath their craggy shelter waiting for a new day. Resources were scant on the isles. Arable land was almost nonexistent on the surface so their ancestors had used the mighty machines of the world before to carve out tracts of land in the shadowy caverns below them. </p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>In this case the term "Over Lord" relates more to the physical residence of said lord moreso than the traditional malignant defintion. These are the powerful houses &amp; clans that have made their home near the surface of the isles. The ornate carved halls, collonnades, and flowing fresh water cisterns were the first ones crafted by the forefathers. The Black Islanders consider this place to be more than just a lovely accent to place they called home, but hallowed ground. Without the wisdom and planning of those that came before them they would have perished cruelly like the countless host of nations that did.</p>

          <p>The beating heart of the Black Isles was the Engineer's Union. Not only was it the center of innovation &amp; most significant factor in the survival of the people, it served as a forum for those that labored to be heard by those that owned. In the time that came to be called the Age of Hope, their was usually very little of that precious light around. This is why the Union was special. A place of order and sometimes progess in a broken world was a rare thing. The Union had many leaders but two of them were indispensable in the Union's history.</p>
